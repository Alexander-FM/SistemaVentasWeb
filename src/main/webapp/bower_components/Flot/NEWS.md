## Flot 0.8.3 ##

### Changes ###

- Updated example code to avoid encouraging unnecessary re-plots.
  (patch by soenter, pull request #1221)

### Bug fixes ###

 - Added a work-around to disable the allocation of extra space for first and
   last axis ticks, allowing plots to span the full width of their container.
   A proper solution for this bug will be implemented in the 0.9 release.
   (reported by Josh Pigford and andig, issue #1212, pull request #1290)

 - Fixed a regression introduced in 0.8.1, where the last tick label would
   sometimes wrap rather than extending the plot's offset to create space.
   (reported by Elite Gamer, issue #1283)

 - Fixed a regression introduced in 0.8.2, where the resize plugin would use
   unexpectedly high amounts of CPU even when idle.
   (reported by tommie, issue #1277, pull request #1289)

 - Fixed the selection example to work with jQuery 1.9.x and later.
   (reported by EGLadona and dmfalke, issue #1250, pull request #1285)

 - Added a detach shim to fix support for jQuery versions earlier than 1.4.x.
   (reported by ngavard, issue #1240, pull request #1286)

 - Fixed a rare 'Uncaught TypeError' when using the resize plugin in IE 7/8.
   (reported by tleish, issue #1265, pull request #1289)

 - Fixed zoom constraints to apply only in the direction of the zoom.
   (patch by Neil Katin, issue #1204, pull request #1205)

   (patch by Phil Tsarik, pull request #1238)

 - Fixed broken auto-scale behavior when using deprecated [x|y]2axis options.
   (reported by jorese, issue #1228, pull request #1284)

 - Exposed the dateGenerator function on the plot object, as it used to be
   before time-mode was moved into a separate plugin.
   (patch by Paolo Valleri, pull request #1028)


## Flot 0.8.2 ##

### Changes ###

   (patches by Patrik Ragnarsson, pull requests #1085 and #1086)

 - Updated inlined jQuery Resize to the latest version to fix errors.
   (reported by Matthew Sabol and sloker, issues #997 ad #1081)

### Bug fixes ###

 - Fixed an unexpected change in behavior that resulted in duplicate tick
   labels when using a plugin, like flot-tickrotor, that overrode tick labels.
   (patch by Mark Cote, pull request #1091)

 - Fixed a regression from 0.7 where axis labels were given the wrong width,
   causing them to overlap at certain scales and ignore the labelWidth option.
   (patch by Benjamin Gram, pull request #1177)

 - Fixed a bug where the second axis in an xaxes/yaxes array incorrectly had
   its 'innermost' property set to false or undefined, even if it was on the
   other side of the plot from the first axis. This resulted in the axis bar
   being visible when it shouldn't have been, which was especially obvious
   when the grid had a left/right border width of zero.
   (reported by Teq1, fix researched by ryleyb, issue #1056)

 - Fixed an error when using a placeholder that has no font-size property.
   (patch by Craig Oldford, pull request #1135)

 - Fixed a regression from 0.7 where nulls at the end of a series were ignored
   for purposes of determing the range of the x-axis.
   (reported by Munsifali Rashid, issue #1095)

 - If a font size is provided, base the default lineHeight on that size rather
   that the font size of the plot placeholder, which may be very different.
   (reported by Daniel Hoffmann Bernardes, issue #1131, pull request #1199)

   coming later in the list no longer has its bar drawn incorrectly.
   (reported by ryleyb, issue #1056)

 - When removing series labels and redrawing the plot, the legend now updates
   correctly even when using an external container.
   (patch by Luis Silva, issue #1159, pull request #1160)

 - The pie plugin no longer ignores the value of the left offset option.
   (reported by melanker, issue #1136)

 - Fixed a regression from 0.7, where extra padding was added unnecessarily to
   sides of the plot where there was no last tick label.
   (reported by sknob001, issue #1048, pull request #1200)

 - Fixed incorrect tooltip behavior in the interacting example.
   (patch by cleroux, issue #686, pull request #1074)

## Flot 0.8.1 ##

### Bug fixes ###

 - Fixed a regression in the time plugin, introduced in 0.8, that caused dates
   to align to the minute rather than to the highest appropriate unit. This
   caused many x-axes in 0.8 to have different ticks than they did in 0.7.
   (reported by Tom Sheppard, patch by Daniel Shapiro, issue #1017, pull
   request #1023)

 - Fixed a regression in text rendering, introduced in 0.8, that caused axis
   labels with the same text as another label on the same axis to disappear.
   More generally, it's again possible to have the same text in two locations.
   (issue #1032)

 - Fixed a regression in text rendering, introduced in 0.8, where axis labels
   were no longer assigned an explicit width, and their text could not wrap.
   (reported by sabregreen, issue #1019)

 - Fixed a regression in the pie plugin, introduced in 0.8, that prevented it
   from accepting data in the format '[[x, y]]'.
   (patch by Nicolas Morel, pull request #1024)

 - The 'zero' series option and 'autoscale' format option are no longer
   ignored when the series contains a null value.
   (reported by Daniel Shapiro, issue #1033)

 - Avoid triggering the time-mode plugin exception when there are zero series.
   (reported by Daniel Rothig, patch by Mark Raymond, issue #1016)

 - When a custom color palette has fewer colors than the default palette, Flot
   no longer fills out the colors with the remainder of the default.

   (patch by vird, pull request #1020)

 - Fixed missing semicolons in the core library.
   (reported by Michal Zglinski)


## Flot 0.8.0 ##

### API changes ###

Support for time series has been moved into a plugin, jquery.flot.time.js.
This results in less code if time series are not used. The functionality
remains the same (plus timezone support, as described below); however, the
plugin must be included if axis.mode is set to "time".

When the axis mode is "time", the axis option "timezone" can be set to null,
"browser", or a particular timezone (e.g. "America/New_York") to control how
the dates are displayed. If null, the dates are displayed as UTC. If
"browser", the dates are displayed in the time zone of the user's browser.

Date/time formatting has changed and now follows a proper subset of the
standard strftime specifiers, plus one nonstandard specifier for quarters.
Additionally, if a strftime function is found in the Date object's prototype,
it will be used instead of the built-in formatter.

Axis tick labels now use the class 'flot-tick-label' instead of 'tickLabel'.
The text containers  for each axis now use the classes 'flot-[x|y]-axis' and
'flot-[x|y]#-axis' instead of '[x|y]Axis' and '[x|y]#Axis'. For compatibility
with Flot 0.7 and earlier text will continue to use the old classes as well,
but they are considered deprecated and will be removed in a future version.

In previous versions the axis 'color' option was used to set the color of tick
marks and their label text. It now controls the color of the axis line, which
previously could not be changed separately, and continues to act as a default
for the tick-mark color.  The color of tick label text is now set either by
overriding the 'flot-tick-label' CSS rule or via the axis 'font' option.

A new plugin, jquery.flot.canvas.js, allows axis tick labels to be rendered
directly to the canvas, rather than using HTML elements. This feature can be
toggled with a simple option, making it easy to create interactive plots in the
browser using HTML, then re-render them to canvas for export as an image.

The plugin tries to remain as faithful as possible to the original HTML render,
and goes so far as to automatically extract styles from CSS, to avoid having to
provide a separate set of styles when rendering to canvas. Due to limitations
of the canvas text API, the plugin cannot reproduce certain features, including
HTML markup embedded in labels, and advanced text styles such as 'em' units.

The plugin requires support for canvas text, which may not be present in some
older browsers, even if they support the canvas tag itself. To use the plugin
with these browsers try using a shim such as canvas-text or FlashCanvas.

The base and overlay canvas are now using the CSS classes "flot-base" and
"flot-overlay" to prevent accidental clashes (issue 540).
